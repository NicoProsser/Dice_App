# Dice_App

This is kinda my first project I did on multiple devices thus this repo is/was really nice

## What I learned

```
First of all I never did anything with dart and/or flutter so I learned the basics
I also learned the setup (e.g. flutter, vs code, all the plugins)
Also the creation and styling of custom widgets and in generell the flutter syntax
Plus installing and working with an android emulator
```

## What it looks like
